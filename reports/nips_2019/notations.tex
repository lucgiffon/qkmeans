%\paragraph{Notations}

The notations frequently used in the paper are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:notation}. 
%
Throughout the paper we use $N$ as the number of data samples and $D$ the dimensionality of a data point. $\rmX \in \R^{N \times D}$ is the data matrix. We denote by $[\![K]\!]$, where $K \in \sN$, the set of all $i$ such as $i \in \sN$ and $i < K$.
%
For a given vector $\rvv$, $\rvv[i]$ is the $i$th component of $\rvv$.
%
For a given matrix $\rmM$, the notation $\rmM_{[i]}$ (resp. $\rmM^{[i]}$) refers to the $i$th row (column) of the matrix $\rmA$, the entry at the $i$th row and the $j$th column is denoted by $\rmM[i,j]$, and $\|\rmM\|$ denotes the Frobenius norm. \addHK{other norms?}
