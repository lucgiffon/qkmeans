We propose a new algorithm called \textit{Q-means} for learning a matrix of K-means center-points which can be decomposed as a factorization of sparse matrices. This decomposition allows us to compute the matrix-vector product of the matrix with any vector in time $\mathcal{O}(K log d)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(Kd)$, if the number of factors and the sparsity constraint are properly defined. We show that our algorithm could be used in the context of the Nystr√∂m approximation in order to speed up its use in subsequent kernel machines.

This paper is a description of work in progress and as such does not contain experimental validation. We give the proposed algorithm with convergence proof, and discuss foreseen experiments and a broader scope of use.\end{abstract}
