\begin{abstract}
We propose a new algorithm called \textit{Q-means} that allows to learn a matrix of K-means center-points which can be decomposed as a factorization of sparse matrices. This decomposition allows to compute the matrix-vector product of this matrix with any vector in time $\mathcal{O}(K log d)$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(Kd)$ if the number of factors and the sparsity constraint are properly defined. We show that our algorithm could be used in the context of the Nystr√∂m approximation in order to speed up its use in subsequent kernel machines.

This paper is a description of work in progress and doesn't contain any experiment. We give the algorithm with convergence proof and discuss foreseen experiments and a broader scope of use.\end{abstract}
